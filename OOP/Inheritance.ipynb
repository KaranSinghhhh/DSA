    "Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a class (child) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). This helps in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability:\n",
    "You can use existing code without rewriting it. For example, if a BasePlayer class has common attributes like hp and methods like walk, other classes like Wizard and Archer can reuse these without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facilitates Extensibility:\n",
    "You can easily add new features. For instance, you can create new classes like Knight or Healer that inherit from BasePlayer and add their own unique methods and properties, extending the functionality of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establishes a Clear Hierarchy:\n",
    "It organizes code in a structured way. The BasePlayer class is the parent, and Wizard and Archer are its children. This hierarchy makes the relationships between classes clear, making the code easier to understand and maintain."
